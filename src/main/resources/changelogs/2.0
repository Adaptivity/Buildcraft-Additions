  - config option to disable eureka research (eureka is still required to run though)
  - minetweaker integration for dusting, refinery and cooling tower (adding and removing of recipes)
  - TiC integration: kinetic capsules can be used to add the 'flux' modifier to your tools (tool uses power and is chargable)
